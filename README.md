# Bouncing Balls Project

> A JavaScript based project with elements from **Weeks 2, 3 & 7** of [MIT xPro Full Stack Certificate Program](https://executive-ed.xpro.mit.edu/professional-certificate-coding?advocate_email=kmp109%40gmail.com&utm_campaign=incentivized_referrals&utm_medium=personal_url&utm_source=referral&utm_content=SO%20-%20MIT%20xPRO%20-%20Professional%20Certificate%20in%20Coding&advocate_source=#referrals-email-capture-modal).

<!--## Status?-->

## Description
A fun "bouncing balls" project to simulate motion, detect edges, redirect motion, with a "factory" to create the balls.

<!-- ### Project Goals: -->

<!--
## Installation
Currently only available on web browsers.
-->
## To Use
This project can be viewed live at [kParsonsDesign.github.io/bouncingBalls/](kParsonsDesign.github.io/bouncingBalls/).

<!--### Support-->

## Roadmap
Current simulator improvements:
- Create an object to store individual ball information to keep track of balls.
- Stop and restart individual balls
- Make "Clear all Balls" button clear divs and timers (currently only clears divs)
- Make bounding box sized based on screen size
- Change timer to use requestAnimationFrame() to optimize for cpu capacity
- Make balls move at different angles. Currently, the balls only move in a 45 degree angle pattern.

Possible Game-like improvements
- Implement HTML Canvas
- Use svg images instead of divs
- Have collision detection betwen balls
- Have user be able to set ball angle and velocity based on mouse/finger drag
- Create a "collector" and gain points
